<p style="margin:4px;"> Many computational models in biology are built and intended for "single-use"; the modeling assumptions and 
descriptions of model elements must be found in the corresponding paper. Expanding models to new and more complex situations is non-trivial. 
As a result, new models are almost always created anew, repeating literature searches for kinetic parameters, initial conditions and modeling specifics. It is akin to building a brick house starting with a pile of clay. Here we present tghe â€‹a database of ModelBricks - well-annotated, reusable component mechanisms that can be assembled into fully annotated mathematical models for cell biology.
